# Ternary Algorithms
All your favorite algorithms but without the brackets

## What is this?
It all started with a 'What if...' and an idea. Could I utilize simple ternary operators to create complex algorithms? Ternary Algorithms is a growing repository that contains all of your favorite algorithms written using only ternary operators and recursion.

## Installing
Download this repository and run
```bash
npm install
```

To test the algorithms for errors, run
```bash
npm test
```

## Have an algorithm?
If you have an algorithm you'd like to add, a pull request would be greatly appreciated! Just remember that it has to be written using only ternary operators.
